= Latin America Trip

These applications have the goals to manage the conferences into Latin America trip. We have three microservices:

* **Speaker**: The speaker microservices that handle with the name, bio, and social media links of a speaker.
* **Conference**: The conference microservices that work with lectures, it has the name, city, and year of the conference trip.
* **Session**: The session in the conference, it has the name, title, description, and both conference and speakers information.

== Databases

Each Microservices a better database to attend its particular request:

The microprofile.io community (http://microprofile.io/) is a semi-new community dedicated to optimizing the Enterprise Java mission for microservice based architectures. The goal is to define a microservices application platform that is portable across multiple runtimes. Currently, the main players in this group are IBM, Red Hat, Tomitribe, Payara, the London Java Community (LJC) and SouJava. Additional key industry individuals are also participating.
