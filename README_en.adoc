= Latin America Trip

These applications have the goals to manage the conferences into Latin America trip. We have three microservices:

* **Speaker**: The speaker microservices that handle with the name, bio, and social media links of a speaker.
* **Conference**: The conference microservices that work with lectures, it has the name, city, and year of the conference trip.
* **Session**: The session in the conference, it has the name, title, description, and both conference and speakers information.

== System Requirements

Internet connection is required in order to download dependencies and for deployment to the cloud. Please install the following tools in your environment so you can follow the workshop:

* Docker (https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/[Windows], https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/[Mac])
* Any Java IDE (for example: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[Intellij IDEA community], https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2019-06/r/eclipse-ide-enterprise-java-developers[Eclipse], https://netbeans.apache.org/download/nb110/nb110.html[Apache Netbeans])
* Any JDK 8 (for example: https://adoptopenjdk.net/upstream.html/[OpenJDK], https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Oracle JDK], https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-8-ug/downloads-list.html[Amazon Corretto]) 
* https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven]
* https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git]
  
Once the previous tools have been installed, you need to download some docker images and maven dependencies. Execute the following commands:

1. docker pull elasticsearch:6.8.1
2. docker pull mongo:3.6
3. docker pull postgres:11.4
4. git clone https://github.com/EventosJEspanol/latin-america-micro-profile.git
5. cd latin-america-micro-profile
6. mvn clean package

== Databases

Each Microservice uses an appropriate database for its particular use case:

|PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and technical standards compliance. It is designed to handle a range of workloads, from single machines to data warehouses or Web services with many concurrent users.

== Eclipse MicroProfile implementations

The microprofile community (http://microprofile.io/) is a semi-new community dedicated to optimizing the Enterprise Java mission for microservice based architectures. The goal is to define a microservices application platform that is portable across multiple runtimes. Currently, the main players in this group are IBM, Red Hat, Tomitribe, Payara, the London Java Community (LJC) and SouJava. Additional key industry individuals are also participating.

|Thorntail offers an innovative approach to packaging and running Java EE applications by packaging them with just enough of the server runtime to "java -jar" your application. It's MicroProfile compatible, too. And, it's all much, much cooler than that: https://thorntail.io/

|Payara Micro is the open source, lightweight middleware platform of choice for containerized Java EE (Jakarta EE) microservices deployments. Less than 70MB in size, Payara Micro requires no installation or configuration and no need for code rewrites â€“ so you can build and deploy a fully working app within minutes: https://www.payara.fish/software/payara-server/payara-micro/

=== Run Applications

First we need to run the database services. We'll use docker for that:

1. `docker run -d --name elasticsearch -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" elasticsearch:6.8.1`
2. `docker run -d --name mongodb-instance -p 27017:27017 mongo`
3. `docker run -d --name postgresql -p 5432:5432  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRES_DB=speaker postgres`

When the services are up, next step is to run the applications:

* Speaker (thorntail):
  1. `mvn -DskipTests clean package thorntail:package`
  2. `java -jar -Xmx512m -Dswarm.http.port=$PORT target/speaker-thorntail.jar`
* Session (kumuluzee):
  1. `mvn -DskipTests clean package kumuluzee:repackage`
  2. `java -jar -Xmx512m -Dkumuluzee.server.http.port=$PORT target/session.jar`
* Conference (Payara):
  1. `mvn -DskipTests clean package payara-micro:bundle`
  2. `java -jar -Xmx512m target/conference-microbundle.jar --port $PORT`


=== Cloud Configuration


Platform.sh is the newest generation of PaaS, which allows the services to manage by the platform itself using infrastructure by code.

* link:.platform/routes.yaml[`.platform/routes.yaml`]: Platform.sh allows you to define the https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/routes.html[routes].
* link:.platform/services.yaml[`.platform/services.yaml`]:  Platform.sh allows you to completely define and configure the topology and https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/services.html[services you want to use on your project].
* `.platform.app.yaml` files: You control your application and the way it will be built and deployed on Platform.sh https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/app-containers.html[via a single configuration file].
